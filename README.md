# 🗺️ Path Finding Algorithm Visualizer

**Path Finding Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive tool built using **Pygame** in Python to visualize how pathfinding algorithms work. It currently supports **A* (A Star) Algorithm*\* and **BFS (Breadth-First Search) Algorithm**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Visualize pathfinding algorithms in a grid-based environment.
* Supports **A* Algorithm*\* and **BFS Algorithm**.
* Interactive main menu for selecting algorithms and starting the visualization.
* Step-by-step visualization showing how the algorithm explores nodes and finds the path.
* Easy to extend for other pathfinding algorithms.
